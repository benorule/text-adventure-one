The story is a murder mystery set in a hotel. The game begins when you are awoken in the middle of a night by a noise that prompts you to investigate, leading to a number of decisions that influence the progression of the narrative. 

The decisions you make as the player can influence both the next decision you are prompted to make and they can also alter the current state which will affect the results of certain decisions. States are used in this particular text adventure to determine the object currently held by the player.
